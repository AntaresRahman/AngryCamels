Hey, those Bowdoin College Polar Bears are stealing water
from the Oasis! Camels, go get 'em while they're in range of fire!

To retrieve the water, we Camels have to throw ourselves at those
stingy Bears. They may be clever, but we are just damn good!
So, make sure we hit 'em by getting the right length and angle for shooting.

REMEMBER: In "Easy" mode, with every shot we miss, we lose one-third of a 
bucket of that precious water to those Bears. If we don't want to die out of
thirst, we better get 'em within 3 shots! 

But if we remain satisfied with the "Easy", WE'RE
NOT DOING ENOUGH TO SAVE THE OASIS SOCIETY! Go for the
"Hard" work because we Camels don't have the word "Easy" in our 
dictionaries! Rewards are doubled in this mode but shhh ... 
so are the penalties.

If you fail to get a bucket, we are still proud of you because we know
you care, and you tried hard or died trying. So ... *PAT ON THE BACK*
